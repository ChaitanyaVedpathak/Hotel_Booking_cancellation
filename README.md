This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help hotels manage bookings more efficiently by predicting the likelihood of cancellations, thereby optimizing room availability and improving revenue management.

Project Overview
In the hotel industry, cancellations can significantly impact revenue management and operational efficiency. Accurately predicting cancellations allows hotels to implement effective strategies, such as overbooking policies, to mitigate the negative effects of last-minute cancellations.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to identify patterns and insights related to cancellations.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Comparing various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
Deployment: Setting up a simple web application using Flask to make predictions on new data.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
Data
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to hotel bookings, such as booking lead time, customer type, deposit type, and market segment. The data is publicly available and has been preprocessed to ensure high-quality input for the machine learning models.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting hotel booking cancellations, offering valuable insights and tools for the hospitality industry to optimize operations and maximize revenue.
